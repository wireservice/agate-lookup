    Fetch a lookup table from the remote source, matches it this table by
    its key columns, appends the value column and returns a new table
    instance.

    :param key:
        A column name or a sequence of such names to match in this table.
    :param value:
        The value that is being looked up. For example :code:`'description'`
        or :code:`'population'`. This is the column that will be appended.
    :param lookup_key:
        A column name or a sequence of such names to match in the lookup
        table. For example :code:`'naics'` or :code:`['city', 'year']`.
        This defaults the same values specified for `key`, so it
        only needs to be specified if the column names in this table
        aren't the same.
    :param version:
        An optional version of the lookup to use, if more than one exists.
        For instance :code:`'2007'` for the 2007 edition of the NAICS codes
        or :code:`'2012'` for the 2012 version.
    :param source:
        An instance of :class:`.Source` that defines where lookup tables
        are located. If not specified a default source will be used that
        points to the
        `wireservice/lookup <https://github.com/wireservice/lookup>`_
        repository.
    :param require_match:
        If :code:`True`, an exception will be raised if there is a value in
        this table with no matching entry in the lookup table.
